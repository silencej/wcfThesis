	withdrawal is followed by resumption of growth cone and microspike
	activity and of axon elongation. In contrast, colchicine causes shortening

	Growth cones and microspikes of elongating axons contain a network
	of 50 Å microfilaments, the pattern of which is altered by cytochalasin
	treatment. These experiments indicate that both structural integrity
	of the axon and continuing function of its motile tip are essential
	elements in axonal elongation.},

  abstract = {Dorsal root ganglion nerve cells undergoing axon elongation in vitro
	have been analyzed ultrastructurally. The growth cone at the axonal
	tip contains smooth endoplasmic reticulum, vesicles, neurofilaments,
	occasional microtubules, and a network of 50-A in diameter microfilaments.
	The filamentous network fills the periphery of the growth cone and
	is the only structure found in microspikes. Elements of the network
	are oriented parallel to the axis of microspikes, but exhibit little
	orientation in the growth cone. Cytochalasin B causes rounding up
	of growth cones, retraction of microspikes, and cessation of axon
	elongation. The latter biological effect correlates with an ultrastructural
	alteration in the filamentous network of growth cones and microspikes.
	No other organelle appears to be affected by the drug. Removal of
	cytochalasin allows reinitiation of growth cone-microspike activity,
	and elongation begins anew. Such recovery will occur in the presence
	of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and in the absence
	of exogenous nerve growth factor. The neurofilaments and microtubules
	of axons are regularly spaced. Fine filaments indistinguishable from
	those in the growth cone interconnect neurofilaments, vesicles, microtubules,
	and plasma membrane. This filamentous network could provide the structural
	basis for the initiation of lateral microspikes and perhaps of collateral
	axons, besides playing a role in axonal transport.},

	tip growth, expansion seems to be restricted to the hemispherical
	apical dome. Cytoskeletal elements have been suspected, from drug
	studies, to be involved in this but electron microscopy has generally
	not confirmed the presence of an apical cytoskeleton. However, in
	a previous immunofluorescence study we reported that microtubules
	could be seen to focus upon the apical dome in tip cells of the moss
	P. patens. In the present investigation F-actin has also been detected
	at the apices of these cells. Anti-cytoskeletal drugs were therefore
	used to differentiate between the roles of actin filaments and microtubules
	in tip growth.At high concentrations (30μM), the herbicide cremart
	de-polymerized microtubules and caused tip swelling. F-actin was
	still present under such conditions but its fragmentation by cytochalasin
	D suppressed this herbicide-induced swelling. On its own, cytochalasin
	D arrested tip growth without causing swollen tips.At lower concentrations,
	cremart disorganized microtubules rather than causing their complete
	depolymerization. Under these conditions, new but swollen growing
	points were initiated along the filament. The addition of taxol to
	cremart-treated filaments tended to reduce swelling and to re-polarize
	outgrowth. With particular combinations of these drugs, multiple
	lateral out-growths were initiated in the vicinity of the nucleus.It
	is concluded: (1) that F-actin is present at the tips of Physcomitrella
	caulonemal apical cells; (2) that unfragmented F-actin is necessary
	for outgrowth; (3) that even disorganized microtubules permit some
	degree of outgrowth but that an unperturbed distribution of axial
	microtubules, focussing upon an apex, is essential in order to impose
	tubular shape and directionality upon expansion.},

	During post-fertilization development of the ovule, a portion of
	the tube may persist in the micropyle, or in the embryo sac, or in
	both, sometimes even in the micropyle of the mature seed. Haustorial
	function has been presumed in a number of taxa. In Grevillea, following
	fertilization, the pollen tube branches at the micropyle, and the
	branches grow intercellularly into the ovarian tissue where further
	branching occurs. A haustorial role of the pollen tube is presumed
	from circumstantial evidence. In gymnosperms (for example, Cycas,
	Zamia and Ginkgo) the pollen tube is nonsiphonogamous, arises from
	the distal (upper) pole of pollen grain, and grows laterally in the
	apical region of the nucellus. The tube branches in Cycas and Ginkgo
	but remains unbranched in Zamia. These pollen tube branches are enucleate,
	and are not concerned with the transport of male gametes for fertilization.
	However, the haustorial role has been well documented. In Podocarpus,
	the pollen tube is siphonogamous and arises from the proximal (lower)
	pole of pollen grain. After traversing the nucellus, the tube forms
	a bulla at the point of contact with the female gametophyte, and
	several branches originate from the bulla. The pollen tube branches
	grow along the inner surface of the nucellus and the outer surface
	of the female gametophyte. The haustorial role of the pollen tube
	branches is uncertain. Procedures for convincingly demonstrating

	to be strongly dependent on the geometry of the patterned laminin,

	subsequent branching. On planar substrata, dorsal root ganglion neurons
	were multipolar, with highly branched neurite outgrowth whereas,
	on 25 microns tracks, neurite branching was reduced or absent, and
	neuron morphology was typically bipolar. These observations indicate
	the precision with which growth cone advance may be controlled by

	eukaryotic walled cells has been widely explored, following the earlier
	indications of their importance by Jaffe, Steer, and their colleagues.
	Analysis of the literature on fungi, with selected comparison with
	other tip-growing plant cells, shows that the growth rate and morphology
	of hyphae are sensitive to factors which influence intracellular
	Ca2+. These factors include variations in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations,
	Ca2+ ionophores, inhibitors of Ca2+ transport, and calmodulin- and
	Ca(2+)-binding dyes and buffers introduced into the cytoplasm. The
	effects of these agents appear to be mediated by a tip-high gradient
	of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ which is obligatorily present in all critically
	examined growing tips. Most recent observations agree that the gradient
	is very steep, declining rapidly within 10 to 20 microns of the tip.
	This gradient seems to be generated by the combined effects of an
	influx of Ca2+, via plasma membrane, possibly stretch-activated,
	channels localized in the hyphal tip, and subapical expulsion or
	sequestration of these ions. Expulsion probably involves a plasma
	membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase, but it is not yet possible to differentiate
	among mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or vacuoles as the dominant
	sites of sequestration. It is suggested that regulation of the Ca2+
	gradient in turn modulates the properties of the actin-based component
	of the cytoskeleton, which then controls the extensibility, and,
	possibly, the synthesis of the hyphal apex. Regulatory feedback mechanisms
	intrinsic to this model of tip growth regulation are briefly discussed,
	together with suggestions for future experiments which are crucial
	to its further elucidation and establishment.},

	of the sporophytic phase. As is well known, the pollen tube elongates
	in a seemingly endless extension of itself as it travels through
	the style to the ovary, seeks out the ovule, grows into the embryo
	sac, and discharges the baggage of sperm. The proportional increase
	in wall area that occurs during elongation of the pollen tube is
	by tip growth. Much of the work on the germination of pollen grains
	on the stigma and growth of pollen tubes in the style was considered
	in Chapter 7; however, this work does not tell much about the requirements
	for pollen germination and pollen tube growth and about the structure,
	growth physiology, and metabolism of pollen tubes. indeed, with the
	insight gained from the knowledge of the complexity and diversity
	of the components of the stigmatic exudate in general, one can only
	wonder about the specific molecules that promote pollen germination

  abstract = {Summary: The role of actin in apical growth and enzyme secretion in
	the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans was studied by treating
	the hyphae with cytochalasin A (CA), which inhibits actin polymerization.
	Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed actin at the tips
	of main hyphae and branches, and at the sites of developing septa.
	CA inhibited the growth of the fungus and changed the growth pattern
	of hyphal tips from cylindrical tubes to spherical beads. The regions
	with swellings showed no actin fluorescence, and neither was actin
	seen in association with septa. After 4 h exposure, hyphae were able
	to resume the normal tip growth pattern in the presence of CA for
	a short period of time and new cylindrical hyphae, with actin fluorescence
	at the apex, emerged from the swollen tips. Later, the tips of the
	hyphae swelled again, which led to a beaded apperance. We also studied
	the effect of CA on the secretion of α- and β-galactosidase. α-Galactosidase
	is secreted into the culture medium, whereas β-galactosidase remains
	in the mycelium, with part of its activity bound to the cell wall.
	When A. nidulans mycelium was incubated in the presence of CA, a
	reduction in the secretion of α-galactosidase into the culture medium
	and a decrease in the α- and β-galactosidase activities bound to
	the cell wall was detected. However, the CA dose used for the hyphae
	did not modify the secretion of the enzymes from protoplasts. Results
	described here provide evidence that a polymerized actin cytoskeleton
	is required for normal apical growth, hyphal tip shape and polarized
	enzyme secretion in A. nidulans. Cytochalasin-induced disruptions
	of the actin cytoskeleton could result in the alterations of apical
	growth and inhibition of enzyme secretion observed by blocking secretory
	vesicle transport to the apex.},

	In the subapex of growing hairs, these bundles flare out into fine

	elongation and induces tube branching and tip swelling. Tip swelling
	is probably caused by disruption of the microtubules in the tip that

	microtubules throughout the tube. Oryzalin and amiprophosmethyl cause
	a complete loss of microtubules from the tip back toward the tube
	midpoint but leave microtubules intact from the midpoint back to
	the grain. Disruption of microfilaments by cytochalasins B and D
	and inhibition of myosin by N-ethylmaleimide or 2,3-butanedione monoxime
	stops tube growth and inhibits germination. Microfilament disruption
	induces short branches in tubes, probably originating from defective
	microfilament organization behind the tip. In addition, confocal
	microscopy coupled with microinjection of fluorescein-labeled phalloidin
	into actively growing pollen tubes indicates that microfllament bundles
	extend into the plastid-free zone at the tip but are specifically

	cultured hippocampal neurons following treatment with bone morphogenetic
	protein-7 (BMP-7, also referred to as osteogenic protein-1). When
	added at the time of plating, BMP-7 markedly stimulated the rate

	Several findings indicate that BMP-7 selectively enhances dendritic
	development. While dendritic length was significantly increased in
	BMP-7-treated neurons, the length of the axon was not. In addition,
	the mRNA encoding the dendritic protein MAP2 was significantly increased

	synapsin I-positive presynaptic vesicle clusters) was increased significantly
	in neurons that had been exposed previously to BMP-7. Because BMP-7
	and related BMPs are expressed in the hippocampus in situ, these
	factors may play a role in regulating dendritic branching and synapse

	in a quantitative, comprehensive manner.Results: Images for ten different
	subcellular patterns (including all major organelles) were collected
	using fluorescence microscopy. The patterns were described using
	a variety of numeric features, including Zernike moments, Haralick
	texture features, and a set of new features developed specifically
	for this purpose. To test the usefulness of these features, they
	were used to train a neural network classifier. The classifier was
	able to correctly recognize an average of 83\% of previously unseen
	cells showing one of the ten patterns. The same classifier was then
	used to recognize previously unseen sets of homogeneously prepared
	cells with 98\% accuracy.Availability: Algorithms were implemented
	using the commercial products Matlab, S-Plus, and SAS, as well as
	some functions written in C. The scripts and source code generated

  abstract = {Tip-growing pollen tubes provide a useful model system to study polar
	growth. Although roles for tip-focused calcium gradient and tip-localized
	Rho-family GTPase in pollen tube growth is established, the existence
	and function of tip-localized F-actin have been controversial. Using
	the green fluorescent protein–tagged actin-binding domain of mouse
	talin, we found a dynamic form of tip-localized F-actin in tobacco
	pollen tubes, termed short actin bundles (SABs). The dynamics of
	SABs during polar growth in pollen tubes is regulated by Rop1At,
	a Rop GTPase belonging to the Rho family. When overexpressed, Rop1At
	transformed SAB into a network of fine filaments and induced a transverse
	actin band behind the tip, leading to depolarized growth. These changes
	were due to ectopic Rop1At localization to the apical region of the
	plasma membrane and were suppressed by guanine dissociation inhibitor
	overexpression, which removed ectopically localized Rop1At. Rop GTPase–activating
	protein (RopGAP1) overexpression, or Latrunculin B treatments, also
	recovered normal actin organization and tip growth in Rop1At-overexpressing
	tubes. Moreover, overexpression of RopGAP1 alone disrupted SABs and
	inhibited growth. Finally, SAB oscillates and appears at the tip
	before growth. Together, these results indicate that the dynamics
	of tip actin are essential for tip growth and provide the first direct
	evidence to link Rho GTPase to actin organization in controlling
	cell polarity and polar growth in plants.},

	tubes deliver the sperm cells to the ovule for fertilization. These
	cells grow exclusively at the apex and at prodigious rates (in excess
	of 200 nm/s for pollen tubes). Underlying this rapid growth are polarized
	ion gradients and fluxes, turnover of cytoskeletal elements (actin
	microfilaments), and exocytosis and endocytosis of membrane vesicles.
	Intracellular gradients of calcium and protons are spatially localized
	at the growing apex; inward fluxes of these ions are apically directed.
	These gradients and fluxes oscillate with the same frequency as the
	oscillations in growth rate but not with the same phase. Actin microfilaments,
	which together with myosin generate reverse fountain streaming, undergo
	rapid turnover in the apical domain, possibly being regulated by
	key actin-binding proteins, e.g., profilin, villin, and ADF/cofilin,
	in concert with the ion gradients. Exocytosis of vesicles at the

	We examined the possibility that one or more members of the distinct

	as molecular switches regulating root hair growth. Specific Rops
	are known to control polar growth in pollen tubes. Overexpressing

	overexpressing Rop7 appeared to inhibit root hair tip growth. Overexpressing
	Rops from other phylogenetic subgroups of Rop did not give a root

	development. Rop2 OX and constitutively active GTP-bound rop2 (CA-rop2)
	led to additional and misplaced hairs on the cell surface as well
	as longer hairs. Furthermore, CA-rop2 depolarized root hair tip growth,
	whereas Rop2 OX resulted in hairs with multiple tips. Dominant negative
	GDP-bound Rop2 reduced the number of hair-forming sites and led to
	shorter and wavy hairs. Green fluorescent protein–Rop2 localized
	to the future site of hair formation well before swelling formation
	and to the tip throughout hair development. We conclude that the

	directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) to
	neural precursors and neurons.HESC were maintained by manual passaging
	and were differentiated to a morphologically distinct OCT-4+/SSEA-4-
	monolayer cell type prior to the derivation of embryoid bodies. Embryoid
	bodies were grown in suspension in serum free conditions, in the
	presence of 50\% conditioned medium from the human hepatocarcinoma
	cell line HepG2 (MedII).RESULTS:A neural precursor population was
	observed within HESC derived serum free embryoid bodies cultured
	in MedII conditioned medium, around 7-10 days after derivation. The
	neural precursors were organized into rosettes comprised of a central
	cavity surrounded by ring of cells, 4 to 8 cells in width. The central
	cells within rosettes were proliferating, as indicated by the presence
	of condensed mitotic chromosomes and by phosphoHistone H3 immunostaining.
	When plated and maintained in adherent culture, the rosettes of neural
	precursors were surrounded by large interwoven networks of neurites.
	Immunostaining demonstrated the expression of nestin in rosettes
	and associated non-neuronal cell types, and a radial expression of
	Map-2 in rosettes. Differentiated neurons expressed the markers Map-2
	and Neurofilament H, and a subpopulation of the neurons expressed
	tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for dopaminergic neurons.CONCLUSION:This
	novel directed differentiation approach led to the efficient derivation
	of neuronal cultures from HESCs, including the differentiation of
	tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons. HESC were morphologically
	differentiated to a monolayer OCT-4+ cell type, which was used to
	derive embryoid bodies directly into serum free conditions. Exposure
	to the MedII conditioned medium enhanced the derivation of neural
	precursors, the first example of the effect of this conditioned medium
	on HESC.},

	and branching in which actin effects tip growth by regulating the
	rate of vesicle flow from proximal to distal regions of a hypha,
	thereby controlling the tip-high gradient of cytoplasmic calcium.
	The actin-controlled calcium gradient at the tip is necessary for
	maintenance of tip growth as well as the dominance of one polarized
	site at the hyphal tip. The phenotype of act1 indicates that actin
	controls the balance between lateral and apical branching.},

  abstract = {The apical wall of growing pollen tubes must be strong enough to withstand
	the internal turgor pressure, but plastic enough to allow the incorporation
	of new membrane and cell wall material to support polarized tip growth.
	These essential rheological properties appear to be controlled by
	pectins, which constitute the principal component of the apical cell
	wall. Pectins are secreted as methylesters and subsequently deesterified
	by the enzyme pectin methylesterase (PME) in a process that exposes
	acidic residues. These carboxyls can be cross-linked by calcium,
	which structurally rigidifies the cell wall. Here, we examine the
	role of PME in cell elongation and the regulation of its secretion
	and enzymatic activity. Application of an exogenous PME induces thickening
	of the apical cell wall and inhibits pollen tube growth. Screening
	a Nicotiana tabacum pollen cDNA library yielded a pollen-specific
	PME, NtPPME1, containing a pre-region and a pro-region. Expression
	studies with green fluorescent protein fusion proteins show that
	the pro-region participates in the correct targeting of the mature
	PME. Results from in vitro growth analysis and immunolocalization
	studies using antipectin antibodies (JIM5 and JIM7) provide support
	for the idea that the pro-region acts as an intracellular inhibitor
	of PME activity, thereby preventing premature deesterification of
	pectins. In addition to providing experimental data that help resolve
	the significance and function of the pro-region, our results give
	insight into the mechanism by which PME and its pro-region regulate
	the cell wall dynamics of growing pollen tubes.},

	Thus, ROP1 controls actin dynamics and tip growth through a check
	and balance between the two pathways. The dual and antagonistic roles

	circadian rhythms. Most studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying
	oscillation have focused on processes requiring a rhythmic change
	in gene expression, which usually exhibit a periodicity of >10 min.
	Mechanisms that control oscillation with shorter periods (<10 min),
	presumably independent of gene expression changes, are poorly understood.
	Oscillatory pollen tube tip growth provides an excellent model to
	investigate such mechanisms. It is well established that ROP1, a
	Rho-like GTPase from plants, plays an essential role in polarized
	tip growth in pollen tubes. In this article, we demonstrate that
	tip-localized ROP1 GTPase activity oscillates in the same frequency
	with growth oscillation, and leads growth both spatially and temporally.
	Tip growth requires the coordinate action of two ROP1 downstream
	pathways that promote the accumulation of tip-localized Ca2+ and
	actin microfilaments (F-actin), respectively. We show that the ROP1
	activity oscillates in a similar phase with the apical F-actin but
	apparently ahead of tip-localized Ca2+. Furthermore, our observations
	support the hypothesis that the oscillation of tip-localized ROP
	activity and ROP-dependent tip growth in pollen tubes is modulated
	by the two temporally coordinated downstream pathways, an early F-actin
	assembly pathway and a delayed Ca2+ gradient-forming pathway. To
	our knowledge, our report is the first to demonstrate the oscillation
	of Rho GTPase signaling, which may be a common mechanism underlying
	the oscillation of actin-dependent processes such as polar growth,
	cell movement, and chemotaxis.},

	used to roughly visualize the distribution of high dimensional gene

	new SVM-based method called multidimensional SVMs, that generate
	multiple orthogonal axes. This method projects high dimensional data
	into lower dimensional space to exhibit properties of the data clearly
	and to visualize a distribution of the data roughly. Furthermore,
	the multiple axes can be used for class prediction. The basic properties
	of conventional SVMs are retained in our method: solutions of mathematical
	programming are sparse, and nonlinear classification is implemented
	implicitly through the use of kernel functions. The application of

	light microscope is the primary method for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis.
	A major shortcoming of conventional microscopy is its relatively
	low sensitivity compared with culture, especially in patients co-infected
	with HIV. In high-income countries, fluorescence microscopy rather
	than conventional microscopy is the standard diagnostic method. Fluorescence
	microscopy is credited with increased sensitivity and lower work
	effort, but there is concern that specificity may be lower. We did
	a systematic review to summarise the accuracy of fluorescence microscopy
	compared with conventional microscopy. By searching many databases
	and contacting experts, we identified 45 relevant studies. Sensitivity,
	specificity, and incremental yield were the outcomes of interest.
	The results suggest that, overall, fluorescence microscopy is more
	sensitive than conventional microscopy, and has similar specificity.
	There is insufficient evidence to determine the value of fluorescence
	microscopy in HIV-infected individuals. The results of this review
	provide a point of reference, quantifying the potential benefit of
	fluorescence microscopy, with which the increased cost and technical
	complexity of the method can be compared to determine the possible
	value of the method under programme conditions.},

	are rare in bone marrow, representing $\tilde$1 in 10,000 nucleated
	cells. Although not immortal, they have the ability to expand manyfold
	in culture while retaining their growth and multilineage potential.
	MSCs are identified by the expression of many molecules including
	CD105 (SH2) and CD73 (SH3/4) and are negative for the hematopoietic
	markers CD34, CD45, and CD14. The properties of MSCs make these cells
	potentially ideal candidates for tissue engineering. It has been
	shown that MSCs, when transplanted systemically, are able to migrate
	to sites of injury in animals, suggesting that MSCs possess migratory
	capacity. However, the mechanisms underlying the migration of these
	cells remain unclear. Chemokine receptors and their ligands and adhesion
	molecules play an important role in tissue-specific homing of leukocytes
	and have also been implicated in trafficking of hematopoietic precursors
	into and through tissue. Several studies have reported the functional
	expression of various chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules

	their chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions may be a powerful
	way to increase their ability to correct inherited disorders of mesenchymal
	tissues or facilitate tissue repair in vivo. The current review describes
	what is known about MSCs and their capacity to home to tissues together
	with the associated molecular mechanisms involving chemokine receptors
	and adhesion molecules.Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest

	xylanase, ZmXYN1, on maize (Zea mays L.) pollen. Transgenic lines
	(xyl-less) containing little or no xylanase in the pollen coat were
	generated with use of an antisense construct of the xylanase gene-coding
	region driven by the XYN1 gene promoter. Xyl-less and wild-type plants

	morphological difference in anther cells and pollen between xyl-less

	biochemical analyses indicated an absence of xylanase on xyl-less
	pollen. Xyl-less pollen germinated as efficiently as wild-type pollen
	in vitro in a liquid medium but less so on gel media of increasing
	solidity or on silk, which is indicative of partial impaired water
	uptake. Once germinated in vitro or on silk, the xyl-less and wild-type
	pollen tubes elongated at comparable rates. Tubes of germinated xyl-less
	pollen on silk did not penetrate into the silk as efficiently as
	tubes of wild-type pollen, and this lower efficiency could be overcome
	by the addition of xylanase to the silk. For wild-type pollen, coat
	xylanase activity on oat spelled xylan in vitro and tube penetration
	into silk were inhibited by xylose but not glucose. The overall findings
	indicate that maize pollen coat xylanase facilitates pollen tube
	penetration into silk via enzymatic xylan hydrolysis.},

	growth of pollen tubes. Although it is established that a class of
	plant-specific RopGEFs promotes the activity of Rop/Rac through the
	catalytic PRONE (Plant-specific Rop nucleotide exchanger) domain,
	not much is known about how RopGEF function is controlled to allow
	a spatiotemporally regulated Rop activity. To understand such a process
	in pollen, we performed functional analysis with a pollen-specific
	RopGEF, AtRopGEF12. Overexpression of AtRopGEF12 had minimal phenotypic
	effects, whereas overexpression of a C-terminally truncated version
	disturbed tube growth, suggesting that the C terminus was inhibitory
	to GEF function. In contrast to non-pollen-expressed RopGEFs, pollen-expressed
	RopGEFs have conserved C termini. A phospho-mimicking mutation at
	an invariant serine within the C terminus of AtRopGEF12 resulted
	in loss of the C-terminal inhibition, suggesting that phosphorylation
	regulates GEF activity in vivo. The PRONE domain of AtRopGEF12 (PRONE12)
	was not sufficient to induce isotropic tube growth. We used mbSUS
	to show that AtRopGEF12 interacts with an Arabidopsis pollen receptor
	kinase AtPRK2a through its C terminus, and BiFC to show that they
	interact in pollen tubes. Coexpression of AtRopGEF12 and AtPRK2a
	caused isotropic growth reminiscent of that seen upon overexpression
	of a constitutively active (CA) Rop. Coexpression of AtPRK2a with
	an N-terminally truncated AtRopGEF12 did not induce isotropic growth,
	indicating a positive role for the N-terminal domain. Our results
	suggest a mechanism by which the noncatalytic domains of pollen-specific/enriched

	comes from the use of 2D smoothening techniques and the idea of center-line

	we found close co-localization of the G-CSF receptor and its ligand
	G-CSF. Here we have conducted a systematic expression analysis of
	G-CSF receptor and its ligand in the developing embryo.RESULTS:Outside
	the central nervous system (CNS) we found G-CSF receptor expression
	in blood vessels, muscles and their respective precursors and neurons.
	The expression of the G-CSF receptor in the developing CNS was most

	Available methods to promote ES cell differentiation towards neural
	lineages attempt to replicate, in different ways, the multistep process
	of embryonic neural development. However, to achieve this aim in
	an efficient and reproducible way, a better knowledge of the cellular
	and molecular events that are involved in the process, from the initial
	specification of neuroepithelial progenitors to their terminal differentiation
	into neurons and glial cells, is required.Methodology/Principal Findings.
	In this work, we characterize the main stages and transitions that
	occur when ES cells are driven into a neural fate, using an adherent
	monolayer culture system. We established improved conditions to routinely
	produce highly homogeneous cultures of neuroepithelial progenitors,
	which organize into neural tube-like rosettes when they acquire competence
	for neuronal production. Within rosettes, neuroepithelial progenitors
	display morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic
	counterparts, namely, apico-basal polarity, active Notch signalling,
	and proper timing of production of neurons and glia. In order to
	characterize the global gene activity correlated with each particular
	stage of neural development, the full transcriptome of different
	cell populations that arise during the in vitro differentiation protocol
	was determined by microarray analysis. By using embryo-oriented criteria
	to cluster the differentially expressed genes, we define five gene
	expression signatures that correlate with successive stages in the
	path from ES cells to neurons. These include a gene signature for
	a primitive ectoderm-like stage that appears after ES cells enter
	differentiation, and three gene signatures for subsequent stages
	of neural progenitor development, from an early stage that follows
	neural induction to a final stage preceding terminal differentiation.
	Conclusions/Significance Overall, our work confirms and extends the
	cellular and molecular parallels between monolayer ES cell neural
	differentiation and embryonic neural development, revealing in addition
	novel aspects of the genetic network underlying the multistep process

	as our model neuronal cell. Six-thousand cellular images of four
	different culture conditions were acquired with two-channel widefield
	fluorescent microscopy. We developed a software package called NeuronCyto.
	It is a fully automatic solution for neurite length measurement and
	complexity analysis. A novel approach based on topological analysis
	is presented to segment cells. The detected nuclei were used as references
	to initialize the level set function. Merging and splitting of cells
	segments were prevented using dynamic watershed lines based on the
	constraint of topological dependence. A tracing algorithm was developed
	to automatically trace neurites and measure their lengths quantitatively
	on a cell-by-cell basis. NeuronCyto analyzes three important biologically
	relevant features, which are the length, branching complexity, and
	number of neurites. The application of NeuronCyto on the experiments
	of Toca-1 and serum starvation show that the transfection of Toca-1
	cDNA induces longer neurites with more complexities than serum starvation.

	However, despite a number of existing studies, this task is still
	challenging, especially when a 3D microscopic image has low single-to-noise
	ratio and discontinued segments of neurite patterns.Results: We developed
	a graph-augmented deformable model (GD) to reconstruct (trace) the
	3D structure of a neuron when it has a broken structure and/or fuzzy
	boundary. We formulated a variational problem using the geodesic
	shortest path, which is defined as a combination of Euclidean distance,
	exponent of inverse intensity of pixels along the path and closeness
	to local centers of image intensity distribution. We solved it in
	two steps. We first used a shortest path graph algorithm to guarantee
	that we find the global optimal solution of this step. Then we optimized
	a discrete deformable curve model to achieve visually more satisfactory
	reconstructions. Within our framework, it is also easy to define
	an optional prior curve that reflects the domain knowledge of a user.
	We investigated the performance of our method using a number of challenging
	3D neuronal image datasets of different model organisms including
	fruit fly, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mouse. In our experiments,
	the GD method outperformed several comparison methods in reconstruction

  abstract = {Motivation: The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a commonly
	used model organism in biology. We are currently building a 3D digital
	atlas of the fruit fly larval nervous system (LNS) based on a large
	collection of fly larva GAL4 lines, each of which targets a subset
	of neurons. To achieve such a goal, we need to automatically align
	a number of high-resolution confocal image stacks of these GAL4 lines.
	One commonly employed strategy in image pattern registration is to
	first globally align images using an affine transform, followed by
	local non-linear warping. Unfortunately, the spatially articulated
	and often twisted LNS makes it difficult to globally align the images
	directly using the affine method. In a parallel project to build
	a 3D digital map of the adult fly ventral nerve cord (VNC), we are
	confronted with a similar problem.Results: We proposed to standardize
	a larval image by best aligning its principal skeleton (PS), and
	thus used this method as an alternative of the usually considered
	affine alignment. The PS of a shape was defined as a series of connected
	polylines that spans the entire shape as broadly as possible, but
	with the shortest overall length. We developed an automatic PS detection
	algorithm to robustly detect the PS from an image. Then for a pair
	of larval images, we designed an automatic image registration method
	to align their PSs and the entire images simultaneously. Our experimental
	results on both simulated images and real datasets showed that our
	method does not only produce satisfactory results for real confocal
	larval images, but also perform robustly and consistently when there
	is a lot of noise in the data. We also applied this method successfully
	to confocal images of some other patterns such as the adult fruit
	fly VNC and center brain, which have more complicated PS. This demonstrates
	the flexibility and extensibility of our method.Availability: The

  abstract = {Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a live imaging and quantitative
	measurement technique used for analyzing motion and turnover of macromolecular
	assemblies in vivo and in vitro. It differs from related imaging
	techniques such as photobleaching and photoactivation in its use
	of substantially lower concentrations of fluorescently labeled assembly
	subunits. When small numbers of labeled subunits and large numbers
	of unlabeled subunits become randomly incorporated together into
	a macromolecular structure, the random distribution of fluorophores
	generates nonuniform fluorescence intensity patterns that appear
	as distinct puncta against low background fluorescence. These puncta,
	called speckles, serve as fiduciary markers so that motion and turnover
	of the structure are visualized. Computational analysis of speckle
	image data transforms FSM into a powerful tool for high-resolution
	quantitative analysis of macromolecular assembly dynamics. Successful
	application of FSM depends on the ability to reliably generate and
	image speckles, which are characterized by their weak emission signals,
	and to effectively extract quantitative information through computational
	analysis of speckle image data, which are characterized by their
	stochastic fluctuations, low signal-to-noise ratios, and high spatiotemporal
	complexity. This article aims to provide a practical introduction
	to basic principles, experimental implementation, and computational
	data analysis of FSM. Examples are used to show the application of
	FSM in analyzing the dynamic organization and assembly/disassembly

	quantification method, called NeurphologyJ, capable of automatically
	quantifying neuronal morphologies such as soma number and size, neurite
	length, and neurite branching complexity (which is highly related
	to the numbers of attachment points and ending points). NeurphologyJ
	is implemented as a plugin to ImageJ, an open-source Java-based image
	processing and analysis platform. The high performance of NeurphologyJ
	arises mainly from an elegant image enhancement method. Consequently,
	some morphology operations of image processing can be efficiently
	applied. We evaluated NeurphologyJ by comparing it with both the
	computer-aided manual tracing method NeuronJ and an existing ImageJ-based
	plugin method NeuriteTracer. Our results reveal that NeurphologyJ
	is comparable to NeuronJ, that the coefficient correlation between
	the estimated neurite lengths is as high as 0.992. NeurphologyJ can
	accurately measure neurite length, soma number, neurite attachment
	points, and neurite ending points from a single image. Furthermore,
	the quantification result of nocodazole perturbation is consistent
	with its known inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth. We were also
	able to calculate the IC50 of nocodazole using NeurphologyJ. This
	reveals that NeurphologyJ is effective enough to be utilized in applications
	of pharmacological discoveries.CONCLUSIONS:This study proposes an

	mammalian cortex. Apart from the shape of the soma and the axonal
	projections, morphological classification is largely defined by the
	dendrites of a neuron and their subcellular compartments, referred
	to as dendritic spines. The dimensions of a neuron’s dendritic compartment,
	including its spines, is also a major determinant of the passive
	and active electrical excitability of dendrites. Furthermore, the
	dimensions of dendritic branches and spines change during postnatal
	development and, possibly, following some types of neuronal activity
	patterns, changes depending on the activity of a neuron. Due to their
	small size, accurate quantitation of spine number and structure is
	difficult to achieve (Larkman, J Comp Neurol 306:332, 1991 ). Here
	we follow an analysis approach using high-resolution EM techniques.
	Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) enables automated
	imaging of large specimen volumes at high resolution. The large data

	a 3D surface model of the reconstructed structures and a 1D geometrical

	Both representations are a prerequisite for analysis of morphological

	Diabetes produced severe functional impairment of C-fibers and rapidly

	These changes were restricted to the distal nerve segments nearing

  abstract = {Motivation: Digital reconstruction, or tracing, of 3D neuron structures
	is critical toward reverse engineering the wiring and functions of
	a brain. However, despite a number of existing studies, this task
	is still challenging, especially when a 3D microscopic image has
	low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fragmented neuron segments. Published
	work can handle these hard situations only by introducing global
	prior information, such as where a neurite segment starts and terminates.
	However, manual incorporation of such global information can be very
	time consuming. Thus, a completely automatic approach for these hard
	situations is highly desirable.Results: We have developed an automatic
	graph algorithm, called the all-path pruning (APP), to trace the
	3D structure of a neuron. To avoid potential mis-tracing of some
	parts of a neuron, an APP first produces an initial over-reconstruction,
	by tracing the optimal geodesic shortest path from the seed location
	to every possible destination voxel/pixel location in the image.
	Since the initial reconstruction contains all the possible paths
	and thus could contain redundant structural components (SC), we simplify
	the entire reconstruction without compromising its connectedness
	by pruning the redundant structural elements, using a new maximal-covering
	minimal-redundant (MCMR) subgraph algorithm. We show that MCMR has
	a linear computational complexity and will converge. We examined
	the performance of our method using challenging 3D neuronal image
	datasets of model organisms (e.g. fruit fly).Availability: The software

	to the female gametophyte. A transcriptomic data set is presented
	as a benchmark for future functional studies using developing pollen
	as a model. Our results demonstrated previously unknown functions
	of certain genes in pollen-tube tip growth. In addition, we highlighted
	the molecular dynamics of core cell-cycle regulators in the male
	gametophyte and postulated the first genetic model to account for
	the differential timing of spermatogenesis among angiosperms and
	its coordination with female gametogenesis.},
